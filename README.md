# Computer_Science_1_Practice_Problems
This is a list of programs that I feel are well suited for a beginning computer science major.  The information will be taken out of book "Starting out with >>> JAVA" 3rd edition by Tony Gaddis &amp; Godfrey Muganda

## Getting Started ##
The first thing that you are going to want to do is download what is called an IDE.  This is the place where all of your coding is going to happen.

For the simplicity of starting, we will be using JGrasp.
JGrasp can be downloaded at https://spider.eng.auburn.edu/user-cgi/grasp/grasp.pl?;dl=download_jgrasp.html

You are also going to need a java developing kit (JDK) which can be downloaded from oracle here https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(Now just one more download, I promise)
On this repository, click the download button to download the entire repository and put it where-ever you want to be able to access it.  Now, you are in business.

## Using JGrasp ##
JGrasp is a great tool because of how simple it really is to use.  When it is time to run a code, there is a little man that looks to be walking.  When you click that the code will run.

To get started, look at the .pdf File in the Do_It folder with the codes.  I have attempted to write it like a textbook to better help understand what is going on.
